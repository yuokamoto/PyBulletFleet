# Tutorial 4: Robot Arm — Joint Control & Pick/Drop

**Source files:**
- [`examples/pick_drop_arm_demo.py`](https://github.com/yuokamoto/PyBulletFleet/blob/main/examples/pick_drop_arm_demo.py) — low-level callback approach
- [`examples/pick_drop_arm_action_demo.py`](https://github.com/yuokamoto/PyBulletFleet/blob/main/examples/pick_drop_arm_action_demo.py) — action-queue approach

This tutorial demonstrates **fixed-base robot arm** simulation: controlling joints,
picking up objects at the end-effector, and dropping them at target locations.

**What you'll learn:**

- Spawning a URDF arm with `use_fixed_base=True`
- Controlling joints with `set_all_joints_targets()` and `JointAction`
- Kinematic vs physics joint control (how `mass` / `physics` affect behaviour)
- Link-level object attachment (`attach_link` parameter)
- Building a pick/drop cycle with low-level callbacks **and** with the action queue

If you haven't read [Tutorial 2 — Action System](action-system), do so first —
this tutorial builds on the `PickAction` / `DropAction` concepts introduced there.

## 1. Fixed-Base Arm Setup

```python
arm_agent = Agent.from_urdf(
    urdf_path="robots/arm_robot.urdf",
    pose=Pose.from_xyz(0, 0, 0),
    use_fixed_base=True,   # pin base to world
    sim_core=sim_core,
)
```

`use_fixed_base=True` prevents the arm from falling or sliding.
The base link is pinned to the world frame at the given pose.

---

## 2. Kinematic vs Physics Joint Control

How joints are driven depends on two factors: the agent's `mass` and the simulation's `physics` setting.

| `mass` | `physics` | Joint control method | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| `> 0`  | `True`    | PyBullet motor control (`setJointMotorControl2`) | Physics-accurate; torque/velocity limits from motor |
| `0.0`  | any       | Kinematic interpolation (`resetJointState`) | Smooth movement respecting URDF `<limit velocity="...">` |
| `> 0`  | `False`   | Kinematic interpolation (auto-override) | Warning logged; kinematic used because `stepSimulation()` not called |

**Kinematic mode** (`mass=0.0`) is recommended for arm demonstrations and fleet-scale
scenarios where physics fidelity is not needed. Joints move smoothly at URDF-defined
velocity limits without requiring `stepSimulation()`.

> **Note:** When `physics=False`, even `mass > 0` agents use kinematic joint control
> because motor commands have no effect without `stepSimulation()`. An info-level
> message is logged once (per process) when this fallback activates.

### Performance

Kinematic mode is **significantly faster** than physics mode for joint control because
`stepSimulation()` is skipped entirely. Joint positions are cached internally
(`_kinematic_joint_positions`), eliminating per-step `p.getJointState()` calls.

See [Benchmark Results — Arm Joint Control](../benchmarking/results) for scaling data
from a representative test environment.

---

## 3. Joint Control API

```python
# Set all joints at once
arm_agent.set_all_joints_targets([1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 0.0])

# Set a single joint by index
arm_agent.set_joint_target(joint_index=0, target_position=1.5)

# Set by joint name
arm_agent.set_joint_target_by_name("base_to_shoulder", 1.5)

# Check arrival
if arm_agent.are_all_joints_at_targets([1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 0.0], tolerance=0.05):
    print("Arm is in position")
```

These methods work identically regardless of kinematic/physics mode — the underlying
implementation switches transparently.

---

## 4. Link-Level Object Attachment

For arm robots, objects are attached to a specific **link** (e.g., the end-effector)
rather than the base:

```python
PICK_LINK_INDEX = p.getNumJoints(arm_agent.body_id) - 1  # last link

arm_agent.attach_object(
    box_sim,
    parent_link_index=PICK_LINK_INDEX,
    relative_pose=Pose.from_xyz(0, 0, 0.14),  # offset from link frame
)
```

The attached object follows the link as joints move.
Use `arm_agent.detach_object(box_sim)` to release.

---

## 5. Approach A — Low-Level Callback (`pick_drop_arm_demo.py`)

The callback approach uses a state machine driven by `are_all_joints_at_targets()`:

```python
def pick_drop_callback(sim_core, dt):
    if step_state == 0:
        arm_agent.set_all_joints_targets(joint_init)
        if arm_agent.are_all_joints_at_targets(joint_init, tolerance=0.05):
            advance_state()
    elif step_state == 1:
        arm_agent.set_all_joints_targets(pick_joints)
        if arm_agent.are_all_joints_at_targets(pick_joints, tolerance=0.05):
            arm_agent.attach_object(box_sim, parent_link_index=PICK_LINK_INDEX, ...)
            advance_state()
    # ... more states for drop, reverse cycle
```

This gives full control but requires manual state management.

---

## 6. Approach B — Action Queue (`pick_drop_arm_action_demo.py`)

The action-queue approach expresses the same cycle declaratively:

```python
from pybullet_fleet.action import JointAction, PickAction, DropAction, WaitAction

actions = [
    JointAction(target_joint_positions=joint_init, tolerance=0.05),
    JointAction(target_joint_positions=pick_joints, tolerance=0.05),
    PickAction(
        target_object_id=box_sim.body_id,
        use_approach=False,       # arm is already positioned by JointAction
        attach_link=PICK_LINK_INDEX,
        attach_relative_pose=Pose.from_xyz(0, 0, 0.14),
    ),
    JointAction(target_joint_positions=place_joints, tolerance=0.05),
    DropAction(drop_pose=box_place_pose, use_approach=False),
    JointAction(target_joint_positions=joint_init, tolerance=0.05),
    WaitAction(duration=0.5, action_type="idle"),
]
arm_agent.add_action_sequence(actions)
```

**Key differences from mobile-robot actions:**

| Parameter | Mobile robot | Arm robot |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| `use_approach` | `True` (navigate to approach waypoint) | `False` (arm is pre-positioned by `JointAction`) |
| `attach_link` | `-1` (base link) | End-effector link index |
| Movement before pick/drop | `MoveAction` (path following) | `JointAction` (joint targets) |

---

## 7. `JointAction` Reference

`JointAction` moves all joints to target positions and completes when every joint
is within `tolerance` of its target:

```python
JointAction(
    target_joint_positions=[1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 0.0],
    tolerance=0.05,       # radians for revolute, metres for prismatic; default 0.01
    max_force=500.0,      # only used in physics mode
)
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `target_joint_positions` | `list` or `dict` | required | Target positions — list by index or dict by joint name. Units: radians (revolute), metres (prismatic). |
| `tolerance` | `float`, `dict`, or `None` | `None` | Completion threshold per joint. See [Tolerance](#tolerance) below. |
| `max_force` | `float` | `500.0` | Motor force (N·m) — only used in physics mode |

### Tolerance

`tolerance` controls how close each joint must be to its target before the action
completes. It accepts several forms:

| Form | Example | Behaviour |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Scalar** (`float`) | `0.05` | Same threshold for every joint |
| **Dict** (`{name: float}`) | `{"rail_joint": 0.005, "base_to_shoulder": 0.05}` | Per-joint by name; joints not listed use the class default (0.01) |
| **`None`** (default) | — | Resolved from `agent.joint_tolerance` on the first tick (see below) |

#### Agent-level fallback

When `tolerance` is `None`, the action resolves it from the agent's `joint_tolerance`
property on the first `execute()` call and **writes the resolved value back** to
`action.tolerance` — making it inspectable after the action starts:

```python
# Set agent-level tolerance at construction
agent = Agent.from_urdf(
    urdf_path="robots/rail_arm_robot.urdf",
    ...,
    joint_tolerance={"rail_joint": 0.005, "base_to_shoulder": 0.05},
)

# Action with no explicit tolerance → inherits from agent
action = JointAction(target_joint_positions=[0.3, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
assert action.tolerance is None  # before execute

agent.add_action(action)
# ... after first tick ...
assert action.tolerance == {"rail_joint": 0.005, "base_to_shoulder": 0.05}
```

The full fallback chain is:

1. **Action-level** — `JointAction(tolerance=0.05)` takes priority
2. **Agent-level** — `agent.joint_tolerance` (set at construction or via property)
3. **Class default** — `0.01` (applied when both are `None`)

This is especially useful for **mixed prismatic + revolute** arms where prismatic joints
measure in metres and revolute joints in radians. A dict tolerance lets you tighten
prismatic accuracy (e.g., ±5 mm) without over-constraining revolute joints.

### Prismatic (linear) joints

`JointAction` works transparently with prismatic joints — target values are in
**metres** instead of radians. See [`examples/rail_arm_demo.py`](https://github.com/yuokamoto/PyBulletFleet/blob/main/examples/rail_arm_demo.py)
for a complete example using a rail arm with 1 prismatic + 4 revolute joints.

## 8. Running the Demos

```bash
# Low-level callback approach (1 arm)
python examples/pick_drop_arm_demo.py

# Action-queue approach (1 arm)
python examples/pick_drop_arm_action_demo.py

# 100 arms — AgentManager grid spawn + bulk action management
python examples/pick_drop_arm_100robots_demo.py

# Rail arm (prismatic + revolute) with EE control and per-joint tolerance
python examples/rail_arm_demo.py
```

Both single-arm demos use kinematic mode by default (`physics=False`). To switch to physics mode,
change the `SimulationParams` line at the top of the file.

The 100-arm demo combines `AgentManager` / `GridSpawnParams` (see
[Tutorial 3](multi-robot-fleet)) with `JointAction` for fleet-scale arm control.
