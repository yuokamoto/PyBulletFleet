(collision-features-demo)=
## Try the visual collision demo

Run `pybullet_fleet/examples/basics/collision_features_demo.py` to observe
`NORMAL_3D`, `NORMAL_2D`, and `DISABLED` objects, collision highlighting, and
large-object multi-cell registration in one scene:

```bash
python3 pybullet_fleet/examples/basics/collision_features_demo.py --duration 30
```

Press `w` in the PyBullet window to toggle collision-shape wireframes. The
demo uses kinematics and `closest_points`, so it is intended to illustrate
collision modes and broad-phase configuration rather than contact forces.

## Collision Detection Method

Controls **how** collisions are confirmed in the narrow phase.

| Method | Freshness requirement | Safety margin | Best for |
|--------|-----------------------|---------------|----------|
| `closest_points` | Immediate query | ✅ Yes | Kinematics (default) |
| `contact_points` | Explicit collision-detection pass | ❌ No query-distance parameter | Physics |
| `hybrid` | Pass for pairs involving physics | Kinematic--kinematic pairs only | Mixed scenes |

### Configuration

**YAML**:
```yaml
physics: false
collision_detection_method: "closest_points"  # or "contact_points", "hybrid"
```

**Python**:
```python
from pybullet_fleet.core_simulation import SimulationParams
from pybullet_fleet.types import CollisionDetectionMethod

params = SimulationParams(
    physics=False,
    collision_detection_method=CollisionDetectionMethod.CLOSEST_POINTS,
)
```

### Auto-Selection

If `collision_detection_method` is not specified, it is selected automatically:

```python
if physics == False:
    collision_detection_method = "closest_points"  # Kinematics-safe
else:
    collision_detection_method = "contact_points"  # Physics-accurate
```

For architecture details, see [Narrow-Phase Details](narrow-phase-details-pybullet-apis).

## Per-Object Collision Mode

Controls collision behavior **per object**. Set at spawn time via `AgentSpawnParams` or `SimObject` constructor.

```python
from pybullet_fleet.types import CollisionMode
```

| Mode | Updates | Grid | Neighbors | Use Case |
|------|---------|------|-----------|----------|
| `NORMAL_3D` | Every move | Yes | 27 (3×3×3) | Drones, 3D robots |
| `NORMAL_2D` | Every move | Yes | 9 (3×3×1) | Ground robots, AGVs |
| `STATIC` | Once | Yes | — | Walls, shelves |
| `DISABLED` | Never | No | 0 | Markers, visualization |

### Setting via AgentSpawnParams

```python
from pybullet_fleet.types import CollisionMode
from pybullet_fleet.agent import Agent, AgentSpawnParams

# Ground robot (2D collision)
params = AgentSpawnParams(
    urdf_path="robot.urdf",
    collision_mode=CollisionMode.NORMAL_2D,
)
agent = Agent.from_params(params, sim_core)
```

### Setting via SimObject

```python
from pybullet_fleet.sim_object import SimObject

# Fixed structure
wall = SimObject(
    body_id=body_id,
    sim_core=sim_core,
    collision_mode=CollisionMode.STATIC,
)

# Visualization marker (no collision)
marker = SimObject(
    body_id=body_id,
    sim_core=sim_core,
    collision_mode=CollisionMode.DISABLED,
)
```

### Runtime Mode Changes

```python
# Temporarily disable collision
obj.set_collision_mode(CollisionMode.DISABLED)
# ... do something ...
obj.set_collision_mode(CollisionMode.NORMAL_3D)  # Re-enable
```

For detailed mode behavior, see [Collision Mode Details](collision-mode-details).

---

(collision-margin)=
## Collision Margin

Safety clearance for `getClosestPoints()`. Only affects `CLOSEST_POINTS` and `HYBRID` modes.

```yaml
collision_margin: 0.02  # meters (2cm default)
```

Set `collision_margin: 0.0` to exclude positive-clearance near misses; touching
and penetrating geometry is still reported. Choose a non-zero margin from the
clearance requirements of the robot and its task.

---

(spatial-hash-cell-size)=
## Spatial Hash Cell Size

Controls how 3D space is partitioned for the broad-phase collision grid. Three modes are available.

### Mode 1: `auto_initial` (Default — Recommended)

Calculates `cell_size` once at first collision check from existing object sizes.

```yaml
spatial_hash_cell_size_mode: "auto_initial"  # or omit (default)
```

```python
params = SimulationParams(
    spatial_hash_cell_size_mode="auto_initial",
)
```

- Calculates `max(median AABB extent × 2, 0.5 m)` from the objects present
  when the grid is initialized
- Does not recalculate on later add/remove operations unless you call the
  recalculation method yourself
- Spawn representative objects before first simulation step
- Recalculate manually after a material change in object-size distribution

### Mode 2: `constant` (Fixed)

Use a fixed cell size provided by the user.

```yaml
spatial_hash_cell_size_mode: "constant"
spatial_hash_cell_size: 2.5  # meters (required)
```

```python
params = SimulationParams(
    spatial_hash_cell_size_mode="constant",
    spatial_hash_cell_size=2.5,
)
```

- Predictable: add/remove operations do not recalculate the cell size
- Requires tuning against a representative workload

Choose a value using the AABB extents of the collision-enabled objects and
measure it with the intended scene. The automatic modes use twice the median
of each AABB's largest extent, with a 0.5 m minimum, which is a useful initial
value for a constant configuration.

### Mode 3: `auto_adaptive` (Dynamic)

Automatically recalculates `cell_size` when objects are added or removed.

```yaml
spatial_hash_cell_size_mode: "auto_adaptive"
```

```python
params = SimulationParams(
    spatial_hash_cell_size_mode="auto_adaptive",
)
```

- Recalculates the same median-based heuristic whenever an object is added or
  removed
- Rebuilds the spatial grid after each recalculation; batch spawning defers
  this until the batch completes
- Appropriate when the object set changes frequently enough to justify that
  rebuild cost

### Manual Recalculation

For `auto_initial` mode, you can manually trigger recalculation:

```python
# Recalculate from current objects
new_cell_size = sim.set_collision_spatial_hash_cell_size_mode()
print(f"Cell size: {new_cell_size:.3f} m")

# Switch mode at runtime
from pybullet_fleet.types import SpatialHashCellSizeMode

sim.set_collision_spatial_hash_cell_size_mode(
    mode=SpatialHashCellSizeMode.CONSTANT,
    cell_size=3.0,
)
```

### Recalculation Behavior

| Mode | Initial calculation | Add / remove | Use when |
|------|---------------------|--------------|----------|
| `auto_initial` | First grid initialization | Keeps the existing cell size | The initial scene is representative |
| `constant` | User-provided value | Keeps the configured cell size | You have measured a suitable value |
| `auto_adaptive` | First grid initialization | Recalculates and rebuilds the grid | Object sizes change during the run |

All modes use the same incremental AABB/grid maintenance and moved-object
candidate filtering during collision checks. Their trade-off is when the cell
size and grid are rebuilt, not a fixed big-O cost for every collision check.

For the cell size calculation algorithm, see [Cell Size & Grid Mapping](cell-size-and-grid-mapping).

---

## Multi-Cell Threshold

Controls when large objects are registered in multiple spatial-hash cells.
Objects larger than `cell_size × multi_cell_threshold` span multiple cells.

```yaml
multi_cell_threshold: 1.5  # default
```

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1.0 | Every object exceeding one cell is multi-registered |
| **1.5** | Default — objects >1.5× the cell size span multiple cells |
| 2.0+ | Only very large objects are multi-registered |

**Example**: With `cell_size=2.0` and `multi_cell_threshold=1.5`, objects larger than 3.0 m are multi-registered.

For implementation details, see [Multi-Cell Registration](multi-cell-registration).

---

## Static-Collision Filter

`ignore_static_collision` controls whether collision checks include pairs with
a `STATIC` object. Its default is `true`.

```yaml
# Set false to detect moving robots against walls, shelves, and other STATIC objects.
ignore_static_collision: false
```

When it is `true`, the collision system skips **any pair containing a static
object**—not only static--static pairs. Keep the default for scenes where
static structures are only visual context; set it to `false` when structures
are obstacles that must produce collision reports.

`check_collisions(ignore_static=False)` provides the same override for one
explicit collision check.
