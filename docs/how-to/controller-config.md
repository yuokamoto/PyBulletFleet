# Controller Configuration

Controllers turn goals, paths, and velocity commands into agent motion. This
guide covers per-agent controller selection, controller chains, and manager
level batch execution.

## Choose a controller

Use an explicit `controller.type` for new code. `motion_mode` remains a
compatibility fallback for selecting the built-in omni or differential base
controller, but it is not the recommended configuration interface.

```python
from pybullet_fleet.agent import Agent

# Built-in controller by registry name.
agent = Agent.from_urdf("robots/mobile_robot.urdf", controller="differential")

# Recommended config form: controller type plus shared limits and implementation options.
agent = Agent.from_urdf(
    "robots/mobile_robot.urdf",
    controller={
        "type": "differential",
        "max_linear_vel": 1.5,
        "max_angular_vel": 2.0,
        "wheel_separation": 0.3,
    },
)
```

### Accepted `controller` forms

| Form | Example | Use |
|------|---------|-----|
| `None` | `controller=None` | Use the legacy `motion_mode` fallback. The default selects `DifferentialController`. |
| String | `controller="omni"` | Select one registered controller. |
| Mapping | `controller={"type": "differential", ...}` | Recommended for YAML and ordinary Python configuration. |
| List / tuple | `controller=[{"type": "omni"}, {"type": "patrol", ...}]` | Build a controller chain. |
| `Controller` instance | `controller=MyController(...)` | Python-only injection of a pre-built controller. |
| `ControllerParams` instance | `controller=ControllerParams(...)` | Python-only shared-parameter override while retaining the `motion_mode` base. |

YAML can use `null`, a string, a mapping, or a list of mappings. Controller
instances and `ControllerParams` instances are Python-only.

```yaml
entities:
  - urdf_path: robots/mobile_robot.urdf
    controller:
      type: differential
      max_linear_vel: 1.5
      max_angular_vel: 2.0
      wheel_separation: 0.3
```

## Controller chains

An agent has one base movement controller and may have high-level controllers
above it. During an update, high-level controllers run first and set goals for
the base controller to execute.

```yaml
entities:
  - urdf_path: robots/mobile_robot.urdf
    controller:
      - type: differential
        default_direction: auto
      - type: patrol
        waypoints: [[1.0, 0.0, 0.05], [1.0, 1.0, 0.05]]
        loop: true
```

- A `KinematicController` entry (`omni`, `differential`, or a custom
  kinematic class) becomes the base controller.
- A non-kinematic entry such as `patrol` or `random_walk` is appended as a
  high-level controller.
- If no kinematic entry is present, the base is created from `motion_mode`.
  Thus a lone `patrol` controller still has a base controller to move the
  agent.

Each mapping accepts `type` (a registered name) or `class` (a dotted Python
class path). Keys matching `ControllerParams` configure shared limits; the
remaining keys are passed to the selected controller's constructor. Batch
controller types are not valid as an entity `controller.type`; configure them
on an `AgentManager` instead.

At runtime, use `set_controller()` to replace the base controller, and
`add_controller()` / `remove_controller()` to manage high-level controllers:

```python
from pybullet_fleet.controller import create_controller

agent.set_controller(create_controller("differential", {"max_linear_vel": 1.5}))
agent.add_controller(create_controller("patrol", {"waypoints": [[1.0, 0.0, 0.05]]}))
```

## `motion_mode` compatibility

```{warning}
**Deprecated for new configurations:** use `controller.type` instead of
`motion_mode`. `motion_mode` remains supported for existing configurations and
fallback behaviour, but new YAML, examples, and integrations should not add it.
```

`motion_mode` is retained for existing configurations and for the coarse
mobile-base hint used by batch controllers. When no kinematic controller is
specified, it selects the built-in base:

| `motion_mode` | Fallback base controller |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| `omnidirectional` | `OmniController` |
| `differential` | `DifferentialController` |

An explicit kinematic `controller.type` selects the base controller instead.
Prefer omitting `motion_mode` in new entity configurations. The legacy
`agent.set_motion_mode()` method replaces the base with the corresponding
built-in controller; use `set_controller()` when changing controllers at
runtime.

## `ControllerParams`

`ControllerParams` holds the limits and behaviour flags shared by kinematic
controllers. `Agent.controller_params` is the authoritative instance. The
legacy `Agent.max_linear_vel`, `max_angular_vel`, `max_linear_accel`, and
`max_angular_accel` properties are read-only views of it.

```python
agent.controller_params.max_linear_vel = [2.0, 1.0, 0.0]
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `max_linear_vel` | Scalar magnitude cap, or `[vx, vy, vz]` per-axis cap in the body frame. |
| `max_angular_vel` | Scalar magnitude cap, or `[wx, wy, wz]` per-axis cap. Differential drive uses `wz`. |
| `max_linear_accel` | Scalar acceleration cap, or `[ax, ay, az]` per-axis cap in the body frame, used to construct translation trajectories. Differential drive uses `ax`. |
| `max_angular_accel` | Scalar acceleration cap, or `[αx, αy, αz]` per-axis cap, used to construct rotation trajectories. Differential drive uses `αz`. |
| `cmd_vel_timeout` | Velocity-command watchdog in seconds; `0.0` disables it. |
| `navigation_2d` | `True` preserves current Z for pose trajectories. `None` and `False` follow goal Z. |
| `default_direction` | Default `set_path()` direction for differential drive. |

All numeric values default to `None`, which resolves to the framework default
when used. This lets a manager provide only the fields that an agent did not
set explicitly.

## Batch controllers

Batch controllers use one vectorised `batch_advance()` call for all agents in
an `AgentManager`. Use them when profiling shows per-agent controller dispatch
is a meaningful cost. They do not replace collision detection, pose commit, or
spatial-grid work.

| Batch type | Per-agent base |
|------------|----------------|
| `batch_omni` | `omni` |
| `batch_differential` | `differential` |

### Python API

```python
from pybullet_fleet.agent_manager import AgentManager

mgr = AgentManager(sim_core=sim, fleet_controller={"type": "batch_differential"})
agents = mgr.spawn_agents_grid(100, grid_params, spawn_params)

# Agent-level commands remain the normal public API.
agents[0].set_path([goal_pose])
```

Agents added with `mgr.add_object(agent)` are registered with the active batch
controller automatically. Existing manager agents can be converted later, or
returned to per-agent execution:

```python
mgr.enable_batch("batch_omni")
mgr.disable_batch()
```

`MoveAction`, `PickAction`, and other action-queue operations still run on
each agent. Batch execution replaces only the base controller's movement
calculation.

### YAML: named managers

Declare a named manager and route entity groups to it. `fleet_controller.type`
enables batch execution; omit `type` to retain per-agent execution while
sharing controller defaults.

```yaml
managers:
  - name: delivery_fleet
    fleet_controller:
      type: batch_differential
      max_linear_vel: 1.5
      max_linear_accel: 2.0
      navigation_2d: true

entities:
  - urdf_path: robots/mobile_robot.urdf
    manager: delivery_fleet
    controller:
      type: differential
    grid:
      count: 50
      spacing: [2.0, 2.0]
```

Manager defaults are applied field by field: an entity's explicitly set
`ControllerParams` fields win, while fields still set to `None` inherit from
`fleet_controller`. For per-agent execution with shared defaults, omit the
batch type:

```python
mgr = AgentManager(
    sim_core=sim,
    fleet_controller={"max_linear_vel": 1.0, "navigation_2d": True},
)
```

Multiple named managers may use different batch types. Retrieve a manager
after config loading with `sim.get_manager("delivery_fleet")`.

### Custom batch controllers

Subclass `BatchKinematicController`, give it a registry name, and import the
module before the manager is constructed:

```python
from pybullet_fleet.controllers.batch_base import BatchKinematicController

class MyBatchController(BatchKinematicController):
    _registry_name = "my_batch"

    def batch_advance(self, dt):
        ...

mgr = AgentManager(sim_core=sim, fleet_controller={"type": "my_batch"})
```

For a custom per-agent controller, use the same `type` registry mechanism or
a dotted `class` path in an entity's `controller` mapping.
