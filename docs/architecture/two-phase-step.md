# Two-Phase Step

PyBulletFleet's `step_once()` exposes a **two-phase pose-commit contract**.
This page explains that contract, the following synchronization work, and what
they mean for callback / plugin authors.

> If you only call high-level APIs (`Agent.add_action`, `controller.set_velocity`,
> `agent.get_pose`), the two-phase split is fully transparent — you do not need
> to change any code. This page is for callback / plugin / ROS-bridge authors
> who interact with poses or PyBullet directly inside a step.

## Design rationale

Separating base-pose computation from the corresponding **PyBullet C-API
writes** lets the simulator:

- batch pose writes for N agents in one pass (`set_poses()`),
- vectorize per-agent compute with NumPy across N agents,
- guarantee that collision detection always sees a consistent world snapshot
  (all writes applied, all AABBs refreshed) within a single step.

```

The set of objects with pending base-pose writes (`_pending_pose_ids`) is built
up during Phase 1, snapshotted for pose commit and post-commit synchronization,
and then cleared. Link-attached
children may add a second, internal flush after their parent's new base pose is
visible to PyBullet.

## `set_pose()` behaviour: buffered vs immediate

Calls to `SimObject.set_pose()` (and `agent.set_pose_raw()`) behave
differently depending on **when** they are made:

| When | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Outside `step_once()`** (test setup, REPL, between steps) | Immediate — writes to PyBullet right away. |
| **Inside `step_once()`** (controllers, callbacks, plugin `on_step`) | **Buffered** — only the cache is updated; the actual PyBullet base pose is written at Phase 2 later in the same step. |

The buffering rule applies to every movable `SimObject` that calls `set_pose()`
inside the step, including a physics-driven object that is explicitly
teleported. In normal use, kinematic objects are moved through this path;
physics-driven bodies should be allowed to move through `stepSimulation()`
instead of receiving repeated pose writes.

For a buffered **kinematic** write, the framework cache is the source of truth
mid-step, so:

- ✅ `agent.get_pose()` / `sim_object.get_pose()` — returns the new cached pose.
- ⚠️ `p.getBasePositionAndOrientation(object_id)` — returns the **previous
  step's** pose during Phase 1, because PyBullet hasn't been written yet.
- ⚠️ PyBullet AABB queries and the framework collision/spatial-grid caches are
  not a same-step pose API. The framework refreshes kinematic AABBs and grid
  entries during post-commit synchronization, after the base-pose flush.

### Rule of thumb

> Inside a callback or plugin `on_step`, **always use the framework getter**
> (`agent.get_pose()`, `sim_object.get_pose()`), never the raw PyBullet API.

If you genuinely need PyBullet to reflect the latest pose mid-step (e.g. for a
raycast against just-moved agents), subscribe to the `POST_STEP` event or defer
the operation to the next step — by then Phase 2 has flushed:

```python
from pybullet_fleet.events import SimEvents

sim.events.on(SimEvents.POST_STEP, on_post_step)
```

`register_callback()` is a Phase-1 callback API; it does not create a post-step
callback. `set_pose()` calls from a `POST_STEP` handler are immediate, but the
step's collision check has already completed. A collision caused by such a
write is therefore observed by the next collision-check opportunity.

### What Phase 1 does not promise

Phase 1 batches framework **base-pose** writes. It is not a general prohibition
on PyBullet calls: joint control may issue PyBullet calls, and application
callbacks/plugins can call PyBullet directly. Framework extensions should avoid
direct base-pose and AABB reads/writes in Phase 1 when they require a
same-step-consistent scene; use the framework pose APIs and the post-step event
instead.

## Profiling

The per-step profiling dict (returned by `MultiRobotSimulationCore.get_profiling_stats()`)
exposes the phase split:

| Key | What it measures |
|---|---|
| `phase1_update` | End-to-end Phase 1 wall time (pre-step events → batch-controller advance → object update loop → callbacks → plugin hooks). Framework base-pose writes are buffered, but joint-control or user PyBullet calls may still occur. |
| `phase2_pose_flush` | Time spent writing buffered poses to PyBullet (`resetBasePositionAndOrientation` loop). |
| `step_simulation` | `p.stepSimulation()` plus AABB/spatial-grid refresh for physics-driven objects. |
| `phase3_aabb_grid_flush` | Time spent refreshing AABBs and spatial-hash grid entries for the kinematic objects flushed in Phase 2. This is the implementation/profiling key; conceptually it is post-commit synchronization, not a third public phase. |
| `agent_update` | Time spent in the per-object `update(dt)` loop inside Phase 1 (subset of `phase1_update`). |
