## Simulation Throughput

**Command:** `make bench-release` (runs the core throughput sweep and the mobile control-path comparison)
**Base config:** `benchmark/configs/general.yaml` — headless `simple_cube`
robots, `collision_check_frequency=null` (every step), `batch_omni` fleet
controller, and the fleet command interface
**Last measured:** 2026-07-24

| Agents | Step Time (ms) | RTF   | Spawn Time | Memory Delta |
|--------|----------------|-------|------------|--------------|
| 100    | 0.70 ± 0.06    | 143.5× | 59 ms     | +2.6 MB      |
| 250    | 1.76 ± 0.12    | 56.8×  | 140 ms    | +6.2 MB      |
| 500    | 4.25 ± 0.30    | 23.5×  | 294 ms    | +12.5 MB     |
| 1000   | 9.88 ± 0.08    | 10.1×  | 604 ms    | +25.0 MB     |
| 2000   | 23.25 ± 1.07   | 4.3×   | 1241 ms   | +48.1 MB     |

**Source:** `benchmark/results/benchmark_sweep_10.0s.json`

The 2026-07-24 sweep was collected on a WSL2 host using the lightweight
`simple_cube` model as the large-scale baseline. The worker currently gives
goals to half of the spawned agents; this workload is defined in
`mobile_benchmark.py`. Although `general.yaml` contains
`moving_agents_ratio` and `max_moving_agents`, the mobile worker does not yet
read those two settings.

The default
`collision_check_frequency=null` setting means collision checks run every
simulation step. More detailed robot models have higher spawn and update costs
and should be benchmarked separately. Timed simulation runs keep
`tracemalloc` disabled because Python allocation tracing materially distorts
step-time and RTF measurements; memory deltas are RSS-based.

**Metric scope:** RTF is the simulation-loop value
`duration / simulation_wall_s`. `simulation_wall_s` measures only the
`run_simulation()` call. It excludes Python process startup, PyBullet setup,
spawning, command setup, warmup, cleanup, and JSON aggregation. Therefore it
must not be read as the elapsed time of a complete benchmark worker.

## ROS 2 Bridge Scale Check

Measured 2026-07-25 with Docker, headless `simple_cube` robots, physics off,
`timestep=0.1`, `publish_rate=5 Hz`, and `target_rtf=0`. These are diagnostic
single-run values and are not comparable to the core simulation table above.

| Mode | Robots | Command result | Max RTF |
|------|--------|----------------|---------|
| `fleet` | 1000 | ack 0.486 s; all moved in 0.104 s | 9.37× |
| `per_robot` | 1000 | publish 0.217 s; 0/1000 moved in 60 s | 0.64× |
| `per_robot` | 100 | publish 0.056 s; all moved in 15.033 s | not measured |
| `hybrid` | 1000 | fleet ack 7.998 s; per-robot publish 0.220 s | 0.30× |

The 1000-robot per-robot result shows why topic publication latency must not be
treated as end-to-end command latency. See `ros2_bridge/PERFORMANCE.md` for
the bridge-specific methodology and recommendations.

## Mobile Control Path Comparison

**Script:** `benchmark/run_benchmark.py --type mobile_control_path --controller per_agent batch --command-interface per_agent fleet --sweep 100 500 1000 --steps 600 --repetitions 3`
**Source:** `benchmark/results/mobile_control_path_sweep_600steps.json`

This is a fixed-step micro-benchmark of the controller and command-ingress
paths, not an end-to-end simulation benchmark. It uses differential
controllers (`--mode diff`), `collision_freq=60`, five warmup steps, and 600
measured `step_once()` calls. Setup time begins after spawning; step time
includes the configured simulation-step work, including collision work.

The command runs the Cartesian product of the two controller implementations
and the two command interfaces. The table below intentionally shows the two
matched, representative paths: a fully per-agent path and a batch-controller
path reached through `FleetCommandDispatcher`. The JSON source also contains
the cross combinations (`per-agent` + fleet and batch + per-agent), which are
useful when isolating one axis at a time.

| Agents | Controller | Command Interface | Setup Time | Step Time | P95 Step |
|--------|------------|-------------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| 100    | per-agent  | per-agent         | 0.0020 s   | 0.118 ms  | 0.149 ms |
| 100    | batch      | fleet             | 0.0016 s   | 0.112 ms  | 0.124 ms |
| 500    | per-agent  | per-agent         | 0.0283 s   | 0.666 ms  | 0.563 ms |
| 500    | batch      | fleet             | 0.0082 s   | 0.661 ms  | 0.383 ms |
| 1000   | per-agent  | per-agent         | 0.0245 s   | 1.526 ms  | 1.592 ms |
| 1000   | batch      | fleet             | 0.0162 s   | 1.290 ms  | 1.397 ms |

**Memory note:** Memory delta is process RSS and should be treated as
environment-dependent, especially on WSL2.

**Scalability:** ~O(n^1.2) across the measured 100-2000 robot sweep on this
WSL2 host.

## Step Time Component Breakdown

**Script:** supplemental profiling with 1000 agents, 50% moving,
`collision_check_frequency=null` (collision checks every simulation step), and
the first 100 measured steps after warmup.

| Component | Mean Time | Share | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Agent / controller update | 4.43 ms | ~46% | Dominant cost; much higher for moving than stationary |
| Pose flush | 0.98 ms | ~10% | Buffered kinematic pose writes to PyBullet |
| AABB / spatial-grid flush | 2.07 ms | ~22% | Refreshes moved-object collision state |
| Collision check | 2.07 ms | ~22% | AABB filtering dominates within collision |
| Monitor update | 0.04 ms | <1% | Near-zero if monitor GUI is disabled |
| Step simulation | 0 ms | 0% | Physics off; up to ~40% with physics on |

> **Profiler note:** Long profiling runs can understate moving-agent cost because
> robots may reach their goals and become stationary. Use a fixed first-window
> profile when comparing with the benchmark table.

---

## Agent Update Cost

**Script:** `benchmark/profiling/agent_update.py --agents 500`

### Stationary vs Moving (500 agents)

| State | Total time | Per agent |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Stationary | 0.29 ms | 0.57 μs |
| Moving | 61.27 ms | 122.5 μs |
| Ratio | **214×** | |

**→ Design decision:** Benchmarks use 50% moving agents as a representative workload.
Moving agent cost dominates: kinematics, trajectory following, and PyBullet API calls
only execute for agents with an active goal.

### Motion Mode Comparison (500 agents, all moving)

| Mode | Total time | Per agent | Relative |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| OMNIDIRECTIONAL | 9.26 ms | 18.5 μs | 1× (baseline) |
| DIFFERENTIAL | 26.66 ms | 53.3 μs | 2.9× slower |

**→ Optimisation note (2026-03-12):** DIFFERENTIAL was previously ~5× slower (90.6 μs/agent).
Replacing scipy Slerp with a precomputed quaternion slerp and removing per-tick numpy allocations
reduced the ROTATE phase from 37 μs to 5 μs. See [Differential Drive Optimization](#differential-drive-optimization) below.

**→ Design decision:** Benchmarks default to OMNIDIRECTIONAL. DIFFERENTIAL requires
heading alignment computation which adds ~2.9× update cost.

---

## Wrapper Layer Overhead

**Script:** `benchmark/profiling/wrapper_overhead.py --n 500 --reps 3`
**Conditions:** 500 objects, process-isolated per layer

| Layer | Spawn time | Update time (get+set pose) | Memory (RSS delta) |
|-------|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Direct PyBullet (baseline) | 63 ms | 2.21 ms | 5.2 MB |
| SimObject | 106 ms (+68%) | 6.80 ms (+3.1×) | 9.2 MB |
| SimObjectManager | 207 ms (+229%) | 10.75 ms (+4.9×) | 9.3 MB |
| Agent | 237 ms (+276%) | 10.60 ms (+4.8×) | 11.5 MB |
| AgentManager | 255 ms (+305%) | 10.20 ms (+4.6×) | 11.6 MB |

**Extrapolated to 10,000 objects (production feasibility, thresholds: spawn < 10 s, update < 150 ms/step, memory < +200 MB):**

| Layer | Spawn | Update/step | Memory | Pass? |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|
| SimObject | 2.1 s | 136 ms | +81 MB | ✅ all pass |
| Agent | 4.7 s | 212 ms | +127 MB | spawn/mem ✅, update ❌ |

**→ Design decision:** SimObject layer is production-viable at 10,000 scale.
Agent layer exceeds the 150 ms/step update threshold at 10,000 (extrapolated 212 ms),
but comfortably passes at 5,000 or below. For ≥10,000 agents, consider using SimObject
directly or batching update calls.

## Collision Mode Comparison (DISABLED / NORMAL_2D / NORMAL_3D)

**Script:** `benchmark/experiments/collision_mode_comparison.py --agents 500 --iterations 200`

| Mode | Step time (mean) | Collision time | vs Disabled |
|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| DISABLED | 1.37 ms | — | baseline |
| NORMAL_2D (9 neighbors) | 2.43 ms | 0.21 ms | +77% |
| NORMAL_3D (27 neighbors) | 2.26 ms | 0.39 ms | +64% |

Collision check breakdown (both modes): AABB Filtering accounts for ~97–99% of collision check time.
Spatial Hashing and Contact Points together are <3%.

**→ Design decision:** NORMAL_2D yields only modest speedup (7%) over NORMAL_3D at this scale
because AABB filtering dominates in both. Use NORMAL_2D for ground robots where Z-axis neighbors
are irrelevant for correctness, not for dramatic performance gains.

---

## Collision Algorithm Comparison (Spatial Hashing vs Alternatives)

**Script:** `benchmark/experiments/collision_method_comparison.py --agents 100,500 --iterations 100`
**Conditions:** spacing=0.08m (dense), kinematic objects (mass=0)

| Method | 100 agents | 500 agents | Collisions detected | Valid? |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| Spatial Hashing (current) | 8.0 ms | 92.1 ms | ✅ correct | ✅ |
| Brute Force AABB | 8.7 ms | 231.9 ms (2.5×) | ✅ correct | ✅ |
| `getClosestPoints` all-pairs | 23.0 ms | 370.6 ms (4.0×) | ✅ correct | ✅ |
| `getContactPoints()` no-args | 0.06 ms | 0.24 ms | ❌ 0 — invalid | ❌ |
| `getContactPoints(A,B)` pairwise | 12.1 ms | 190.3 ms | ❌ 0 — invalid | ❌ |

**Key finding:** `getContactPoints` variants return 0 collisions for kinematic objects (mass=0).
PyBullet's contact point solver only activates between physics-enabled bodies.
Spatial hashing with `getClosestPoints` is the only valid fast method for kinematic AGV-type robots.

**→ Design decision:** Spatial hashing (O(N) average) is used because:
1. It is the only algorithmically valid method for kinematic robots.
2. It is 2.5–4× faster than the valid alternatives at 500 agents.

## Differential Drive Optimization

**Script:** `benchmark/profiling/differential_breakdown.py`
**Conditions:** 1000 agents, DIFFERENTIAL mode (ROTATE phase)

The differential drive ROTATE phase was the single most expensive per-agent per-tick operation.
Profiling identified two root causes:

| Operation | Before | After | Speedup |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Quaternion slerp (scipy Slerp → `_quat_slerp`) | 26.8 μs | 2.3 μs | **11.8×** |
| Scalar clip (`np.clip` → `max/min`) | 6.8 μs | 0.15 μs | **44×** |
| Dead `np.array()` allocations (P0) | ~0.6 μs | 0 μs | eliminated |
| Redundant `np.dot` in slerp (P1) | ~0.3 μs | 0 μs | eliminated |
| Velocity array reallocation (P2) | ~0.3 μs | 0 μs | in-place |
| FORWARD direction recompute (P3) | ~0.5 μs | 0 μs | cached |
| **ROTATE phase total** | **36.1 μs** | **4.9 μs** | **7.3×** |

**End-to-end impact (1000 agents, differential):**

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Per-agent update | 57 μs | 12.4 μs | 4.6× faster |
| DIFFERENTIAL / OMNIDIRECTIONAL ratio | 5.0× | 2.9× | Closer to parity |
| 500-agent ROTATE frame time | 18.0 ms | 2.5 ms | −15.6 ms/frame |

**Why was scipy Slerp slow?**

`scipy.spatial.transform.Slerp` is a generic array-oriented API designed for batch interpolation
(e.g., `slerp(np.linspace(0, 1, 10000))`). When called with a single scalar `t` per agent per tick,
the fixed overhead — input normalisation, dtype promotion, Rotation object wrapping — dominates
the actual trigonometry. The replacement `_quat_slerp` sidesteps this by precomputing
`dot/theta/sin(theta)` once per waypoint transition and using `math.sin`/`math.cos` (C-level scalar
functions) instead of numpy array dispatch.

Absolute timings vary by environment; the ratios above are the meaningful comparison metric.

## Collision Config-Based Comparison (Physics ON vs OFF)

**Script:** `benchmark/experiments/collision_methods_config_based.py`
**Conditions:** 100 objects, 500 steps

| Config | Physics | Method | Step time | Collision time |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| `physics_off_closest.yaml` | OFF | `CLOSEST_POINTS` | 1.51 ms | 1.24 ms |
| `physics_on_contact.yaml` | ON | `CONTACT_POINTS` | 2.64 ms | 1.41 ms |
| `hybrid.yaml` | ON | `HYBRID` | 2.00 ms | 1.27 ms |

Physics ON adds ~75% step overhead due to the physics engine stepping each simulation step.

**→ Design decision:** Default is `physics=false` (kinematics mode) for maximum throughput.
Use `physics=true` only when rigid-body dynamics are required.

**Source:** `benchmark/results/collision_methods_config_based.txt`

## Arm Joint Control Performance

**Script:** `benchmark/profiling/arm_joint_update.py --test scaling`
**Conditions:** arm_robot.urdf (4 revolute joints), fixed-base, JointAction cycling, 100 steps per count

### Physics vs Kinematic Scaling

| Arms | Joints | Physics (ms/step) | Kinematic (ms/step) | Ratio |
|------|--------|--------------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1    | 4      | 0.029              | 0.010               | 2.8×  |
| 5    | 20     | 0.082              | 0.056               | 1.5×  |
| 10   | 40     | 0.152              | 0.090               | 1.7×  |
| 25   | 100    | 0.415              | 0.253               | 1.6×  |
| 50   | 200    | 0.886              | 0.552               | 1.6×  |

Kinematic mode is consistently faster than physics mode for joint control.
The gap comes from skipping `stepSimulation()` — kinematic mode uses `resetJointState()`
with per-step interpolation at URDF velocity limits.
Exact ratios are environment-dependent; the trend (kinematic faster) is consistent.

### Component Breakdown (10 arms)

**Script:** `benchmark/profiling/arm_joint_update.py --test builtin --arms 10`

| Component | Physics | Kinematic |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| agent_update | 27.0% (0.050 ms) | 96.7% (0.087 ms) |
| step_simulation | 69.6% (0.129 ms) | 0.2% (0.000 ms) |
| callbacks | 1.0% | 0.4% |
| **total** | **0.186 ms** | **0.090 ms** |

In physics mode, `stepSimulation()` dominates (70%). In kinematic mode, the physics engine
is bypassed entirely — agent_update (joint interpolation + `resetJointState`) is the sole cost.

### Kinematic Joint Cache Optimization

**Problem:** cProfile showed `p.getJointState()` consuming ~36% of kinematic update time
(called per-joint per-step to read current positions before interpolating).

**Solution:** `_kinematic_joint_positions` cache — joint positions stored in a Python dict,
initialized via batch `p.getJointStates()` at agent creation, updated after each `resetJointState()`.
`get_joint_state()` returns cached values for kinematic robots (zero PyBullet calls).

| Metric | Before cache | After cache | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 50 arms step time | 0.826 ms | 0.552 ms | **1.5× faster** |
| `p.getJointState` calls/step | 200 (50 arms × 4 joints) | 0 | **eliminated** |

**→ Design decision:** Kinematic joint cache is always active for `mass=0.0` URDF robots.
The cache is invisible to callers — `get_joint_state()` API is unchanged.

*Data collected 2026-03-15. Absolute timings and ratios are environment-dependent
(CPU, OS, PyBullet version). The qualitative trends — kinematic faster than physics,
cache eliminating per-step PyBullet calls — are expected to hold across environments.
Re-run `benchmark/profiling/arm_joint_update.py` to obtain numbers for your setup.*
