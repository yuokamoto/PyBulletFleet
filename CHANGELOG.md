## [Unreleased]

## v0.6.0 (2026-06-26)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed intermittent multi-second freezes during `run_simulation()`.** The
  real-time loop paced off the wall clock, so a wall-clock jump (NTP correction,
  host suspend/resume, WSL2 drift) could desync it into a long `time.sleep()` —
  the sim "froze" then "suddenly resumed". It now paces on the monotonic clock,
  converts the catch-up sleep correctly for `target_rtf != 1` (it previously
  over-slept ~`rtf`×), and clamps any residual sleep so it can never freeze.

### Features

- Added `SimulationParams.max_sleep_frames` (default 4.0) to bound the real-time
  sleep, mirroring the existing `max_steps_per_frame` catch-up cap.

## v0.5.0 (2026-06-25)

Try the examples straight from a `pip install` — no repo clone needed.

### Features

- **Examples ship in the wheel + a `pybullet-fleet` CLI.** After
  `pip install pybullet-fleet`, list / locate / copy / run the bundled demos:
  ```
  pybullet-fleet examples --list
  pybullet-fleet examples --path
  pybullet-fleet examples --run path_following_demo.py [--robot racecar]
  pybullet-fleet examples --copy ./my-examples
  ```
  `--run` forwards extra flags to the demo; `--copy` extracts them for editing.
- Expose `pybullet_fleet.__version__`.

### Internal

- Bridge: fixed the previously-failing `pybullet_fleet_ros` tests and now run
  `colcon test` in CI (the bridge unit tests were never gated before).
- Added a clean-install CI check that the published wheel actually ships the
  bundled examples, and per-demo compile tests so a broken example is caught.

## v0.4.1 (2026-06-24)

Packaging patch: the v0.4.0 wheel shipped **without** its bundled data, so
pip-installed users could not load the built-in robots, configs, or meshes.
This release makes that data ship in the wheel and resolve correctly.

### Bug Fixes

- Bundle the built-in `robots/`, `config/`, and `mesh/` data in the wheel —
  pip-installed users can now load the bundled URDFs, configs, and meshes that
  were missing from the v0.4.0 wheel.
- Resolve bundled assets from a relative path (e.g. `"config/config.yaml"`,
  `"robots/arm_robot.urdf"`) whether you run from the repo or a pip install.

### Internal

- Add a clean-install packaging smoke test (`make test-clean-install`, a
  standalone script, and a Docker image) plus a release-time wheel-verify gate,
  so missing bundled data is caught before publishing.
- Add CI coverage: path-filtered packaging (clean-venv install) and ROS 2
  bridge (Docker integration) workflows.
- Pin `numpy<2` in the bridge image to match the ROS 2 Jazzy runtime.

## v0.4.0 (2026-06-22)

First release with the **ROS 2 bridge and Open-RMF integration**, an event
system, SDF world loading, vectorized batch controllers, and a plugin/device
architecture.

### Highlights

- **ROS 2 bridge** (`ros2_bridge/`, ROS 2 Jazzy) — drive PyBulletFleet from ROS 2:
  per-robot odom / TF / cmd_vel / goal_pose / joint topics; NavigateToPose,
  FollowPath and FollowJointTrajectory actions; and `simulation_interfaces`
  services (spawn / delete / get entities, step simulation, simulator features).
  Dockerized with an integration smoke test.
- **Open-RMF integration** — fleet adapter plus handlers for doors, lifts,
  delivery, cleaning, and battery, with runnable demos: office, hotel, clinic,
  airport_terminal, battle_royale, and campus.
- **EventBus** — global and per-entity lifecycle events (object/agent spawn &
  remove, pre/post step & update, action start/complete, collision enter/exit)
  for plugins and external integrations.
- **SDF loader** — load multi-model SDF worlds, with `<submesh>` extraction from
  multi-part meshes, `model_yaw_offset`, and `force_color` flat-shading for
  meshes PyBullet cannot texture.
- **Batch controllers** — vectorized omnidirectional and differential controllers
  (two-phase step) for efficiently simulating large fleets.
- **Plugin & device architecture** — per-agent plugins (e.g. battery) and
  simulation plugins (e.g. workcell delivery); `Door` and `Elevator` agent
  subclasses with joint control and automatic passenger attachment.

### Features

- Unified `controller=` API: registry name, dict, list, `ControllerParams`, or a
  prebuilt controller; `type:` (registry) / `class:` (dotted import path)
  selection; patrol and random-walk high-level controllers; per-axis kinematic
  limits and `navigation_2d`.
- `resolve_model()` resolves Tier 1/2/3 model names (bundled, ROS description
  packages, `robot_descriptions`) to URDF paths.
- `CameraController` — interactive right-drag pan, zoom, and top-down view.
- `pybullet_fleet_msgs` package (ExecuteAction action).

### Bug Fixes

_(Fixes to behaviour from v0.3.0; issues introduced and resolved within this
release's new features are omitted.)_

- Collision detection was silently disabled when the simulation was loaded from
  YAML — the `collision_detection_method` string is now coerced to its enum.
- Per-axis velocity/acceleration limits with a zero-capped axis (e.g.
  `max_linear_vel: [0.3, 3.0, 0.0]`) no longer produce a NaN limit.

### Documentation

- ROS 2 bridge / Docker guide; corrected headless, env-var, and config-file docs;
  2026-06-20 implementation audit; a single shared agent-instructions source for
  GitHub Copilot and Claude Code.

### Performance

- Kinematics mode (headless, AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350): ~64× real-time at 100
  agents, ~10× at 500, ~4.4× at 1000. See `docs/benchmarking/results.md`.

## v0.3.0 (2026-04-08)

### Breaking Changes

- `DifferentialPhase` removed — motion phase logic is now owned by `DifferentialController` / `OmnidirectionalController` in `controller.py`

### Highlights

- **SimulationRecorder** — Headless and GUI video capture (GIF/MP4) via `start_recording()` API or `RECORD` environment variable
- **Centralized defaults** — All parameter defaults in `_defaults.py` with `PBF_*` env-var overrides and `.env` file support
- **Visual documentation** — Embedded demo videos across all doc pages, YAML-driven batch capture scripts
- **Robot model resolution** — `resolve_model("panda")` finds URDFs/SDFs by name across local, pybullet_data, and robot_descriptions sources (`resolve_urdf` kept as deprecated alias)
- **Controller refactor** — `Controller` extracted from `Agent` into `controller.py`, reducing `agent.py` by ~500 lines
- **Entity registry** — `register_entity_class()` for custom spawn types via YAML config

### Features

- `SimulationRecorder` — camera modes (auto, gui, orbit, manual), time bases (sim, real), GIF/MP4 output
- `start_recording()` / `stop_recording()` on `MultiRobotSimulationCore`; `RECORD` env-var enables auto-recording in `run_simulation()`
- `_defaults.py` — single source of truth for all defaults; `PBF_{SECTION}_{KEY}` env-var overrides; `.env` auto-loading via python-dotenv
- `robot_models.py` — `resolve_model()`, `auto_detect_profile()`, `register_model()`, `discover_models()`, `add_search_path()` (`resolve_urdf()` kept as deprecated alias)
- `controller.py` — `OmnidirectionalController`, `DifferentialController` extracted from Agent
- `entity_registry.py` — `register_entity_class()` for extensible YAML-driven spawning
- `compute_scene_bounds()` — scene AABB for auto-framing cameras
- `unregister_callback()` — remove callbacks by function identity
- `SimulationParams.enable_floor` — option to skip ground plane loading
- `[models]` extra in `pyproject.toml` — `pip install pybullet-fleet[models]` pulls `robot_descriptions`
- New demo scripts: `capture_demo.py` (headless), `capture_screen_demo.py` (GUI), `capture_model_catalog.py`
- Examples reorganized into `arm/`, `basics/`, `mobile/`, `scale/`, `models/` subdirectories
