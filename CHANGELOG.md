# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

Snapshot/replay entries in this section describe development and validation
profiles. They do not provide general save/load for ordinary simulations and
are not recommended for production use yet.

### Changed

- `Agent.from_urdf()` and `SimObject.from_urdf()` load through one shared
  helper, `load_urdf_body()`. `Agent.from_urdf()` gains `global_scaling` and
  now raises `FileNotFoundError` for a URDF it cannot read, where it
  previously let PyBullet's own `error` escape -- the two factories had
  drifted on both points.

- `build_tpi()` accepts a `decel` argument instead of pinning `dec_max` to
  `accel`. `TwoPointInterpolation` has always supported an independent
  deceleration; the wrapper was discarding it.

- The batched controllers honour `max_linear_decel` too.
  `trapezoid_distance()` takes the braking scalar as its own argument instead
  of reusing the acceleration one, and `extract_phase_params()` returns it
  alongside -- the phase durations in `tpi.dt` were already the asymmetric
  ones. Batched and per-agent trajectories agree to floating-point noise on
  the same profile. Rotation stays symmetric, angular limits having no
  separate deceleration.

- `Agent.set_path()` marks the agent moving only once the controller has
  accepted the path, and the batched controllers set the flag inside the lock
  that guards their array writes, so a controller that refuses a path does
  not leave an idle agent reporting `is_moving`.

- `OmniController.capture_straight_navigation()` now rejects an asymmetric
  profile. Its record carries a single `accel`, so such a trajectory could not
  be rebuilt from it; the checkpoint schema is unchanged.
- An optional state-recorder error during a command, object spawn/removal, or
  completed-step capture now stops recording with an explicitly incomplete
  artifact while the simulation operation continues. GUI playback selects the
  first available checkpoint at the configured cadence. Checkpoint restore
  also verifies the recorded result and input streams before loading state.
  Accepted inputs issued outside the final step are flushed when recording
  closes, including runs with no completed steps. Closing a recorder detaches
  it from the simulation, so subsequent steps continue without recording.

- Group corridor policy evaluation programs under `examples/evaluation/` and
  checkpoint/state-discovery programs under `examples/validation/`. Their
  Python module paths and documented run commands now use those folders.

### Added

- Add `SimObject.from_urdf()` and a `urdf_path` field on
  `SimObjectSpawnParams`, so a URDF-defined body with no behaviour can be
  loaded as a plain `SimObject` instead of an `Agent`. `from_sdf()` already
  covered SDF; URDF had no non-agent loader, and `urdf_path` existed only on
  `AgentSpawnParams`. Static scenery created this way stays out of the
  per-step update loop (`_needs_update` is `False`): measured on a scene of
  2376 fixed-base, jointless, controller-less bodies, 15.98 ms per step as
  Agents against 0.78 ms as SimObjects.

- Add `ControllerParams.max_linear_decel` (scalar or per-axis, same semantics
  as `max_linear_accel`) so vehicles that brake harder — or softer — than they
  accelerate can be modelled. Leaving it unset mirrors `max_linear_accel`, so
  existing configurations keep their symmetric trapezoid unchanged.
  `Agent.max_linear_decel`, `ControllerParams.linear_decel_along_direction()`
  and `ControllerParams.scalar_max_linear_decel()` round out the accessors.
- Add `MultiRobotSimulationCore.close()` and context-manager support.
  `run_simulation()` has always released the client on its way out, but a
  program driving `step_once()` itself, or a test that only builds a scene,
  never reached that code and nothing else disconnected. Because PyBullet's
  module-level calls resolve against a default client, a leaked client made
  the *next* simulation in the process report bodies and joints "not found"
  rather than failing where the leak happened. `close()` is safe to call more
  than once and on a simulation that was never run.
- Add `Agent.set_joint_motion_profile()`, and `max_speed` / `max_accel` /
  `max_decel` on `ElevatorParams`. A kinematic joint ran at the URDF's
  `<limit velocity="...">` and reached it instantly, so its speed was a
  property of the model file -- two installations differing only in how fast
  a cabin travels needed two URDFs, and
  `changeDynamics(maxJointVelocity=...)` does not help because
  `getJointInfo()` keeps reporting the original. Giving an acceleration makes
  the travel a trapezoid solved by `TwoPointInterpolation`, the same solver
  the linear controllers use: 0.6 m at 0.4 m/s takes 1.5 s flat and 1.9 s
  with 1.0 m/s^2 ramps. Both are opt-in; with neither, and with a speed but
  no acceleration, the joint keeps the constant-speed behaviour it always
  had. A target a ramped joint cannot stop at -- one inside its braking
  distance, one it is moving away from, or one set to where it already is --
  brakes at the configured rate and re-plans rather than snapping to the
  target. A profile can be changed while the joint moves: it keeps the speed
  it is carrying and re-plans from it under the new limits.
  `Agent.has_joint_trajectory()` reports whether a ramped joint is still
  moving, which `Elevator` arrival now waits for instead of taking the
  action's tolerance as arrival.

- Add name-based simulation entity lookup on `MultiRobotSimulationCore`:
  ordered multi-result searches for objects and agents, plus unique-result
  helpers that raise `LookupError` when a name is missing or ambiguous.

- Add opt-in, per-completed-step execution recording for the supported
  physics-off omni manipulation scenario, including its generated approach
  waypoint and final orientation turn, with fresh-process checkpoint
  restore/resume and result playback through the same example CLI. Capture
  every joint position/configured target on the supported robot, kinematic
  attachment relation, box lifecycle and
  scenario progress in a versioned profile; unsupported active state marks
  recording incomplete rather than being silently omitted.
  The common recorder accepts declared profiles and named, versioned data
  callbacks. The example's Omni/box profile lives under `examples/validation/`.

- Add a profile-limited, fresh-process checkpoint/restore proof for one
  physics-off omni robot in straight navigation, with explicit
  `run_simulation(resume=True)` continuation and a three-process example.
  All three proof modes support optional GUI viewing and auto-named result
  paths when `--output` is omitted.
- Add an optional-GUI mobile-manipulator state-discovery example that exercises
  runtime object spawn/delete, base and joint motion, link attachment and
  detachment, and completed-step observations without adding checkpoint APIs.
- Add a one-sided corridor traffic experiment that compares ordinary kinematic
  passage through an entrance-side merge with an external collision-triggered
  stop/restart rule, optional
  single-policy GUI observation, auto-named result directories, and reports
  of all-robot passage time and blocking evidence.
  A stopped conflict-group winner resumes immediately so the external response
  does not stop every moving member of that group.
- Expose the latest collision-check observation, including active pair IDs,
  detection branch, signed closest-point distance and sample time, without a
  second all-pairs query.
- Add a synthetic 20-robot corridor evaluation example with independent entry
  policies, optional single-policy GUI observation, task/collision evidence,
  and simulated-time fleet metrics.
- Add a macOS launcher for viewing Linux GUI examples in a browser via Colima
  and noVNC.
- Opt-in, versioned kinematic navigation replay: record effective Fleet API navigate/stop inputs, reconstruct a fresh supported initial world, and compare acknowledgements, events and full observations. Supports omni/batch_omni, stable artifact entity IDs, integrity validation and explicit changed-configuration comparisons; does not provide checkpoint/resume or ROS/DDS replay.

### Changed

- Align the one-sided traffic example's `run_policy()` and report `policy` name
  with the bidirectional evaluation example. In its version 2 report, name route
  phases `entrance`, `exit` and `destination` instead of using numeric indices.
- Extend the one-sided traffic example's external collision response through
  endpoint arrival, and report all-robot endpoint time separately from corridor
  passage time.
- Shorten both corridor examples to a 1.5 m passage; start the bidirectional
  evaluation GUI closer to the action, auto-name its output directory when
  no path is supplied, and allow both examples to show the live DataMonitor
  with `--gui --monitor`.
- Move the traffic-experiment GUI camera closer and allow arrow-key panning in
  PBF's interactive camera controller.
- Keep replay input application and result capture in `ReplaySession`, without replay-specific mutation guards in ordinary simulation and Fleet APIs. Direct core calls are outside the recorded-input contract.

### Fixed

- `Agent.set_controller()` now adopts the controller's own
  `ControllerParams` as the agent's `controller_params`, matching what
  `Agent.__init__` does when the controller is passed at construction.
  Previously the two diverged silently: the controller moved the agent by its
  own limits while `controller_params` -- which `Agent.max_linear_vel` and its
  siblings delegate to, and which a batch controller builds its trajectory
  from -- still held the defaults. A fleet that set its limits this way ran
  correctly under the per-agent controllers and at the default 2.0 m/s and
  5.0 m/s under a batch controller.
- An `AgentManager` holding a plain `SimObject` no longer raises
  `AttributeError`. `spawn_from_config()` dispatches on each entry's `type`,
  so a config may mix `agent` and `sim_object` and a mixed manager is a
  supported arrangement, but every method that commands movement, reads
  motion state or queues actions reached for attributes only an `Agent` has
  -- `repr()` among them, by way of `get_moving_count()`. They now read a new
  `AgentManager.agents` property, which filters. `set_goal_pose()` indexes
  that property rather than `objects`, so a non-agent no longer shifts the
  index of every agent after it.
- `AgentSpawnParams.pickable` now reaches the agent. Neither
  `Agent.from_mesh` nor `Agent.from_urdf` took the argument, so
  `forward_spawn_params()` dropped it and `Agent.__init__` overwrote the flag
  with `False` unconditionally -- the field was inert. `attach_object()`
  refuses a non-pickable body, so an agent meant to be carried failed to
  attach, far from where it was configured. The default is unchanged:
  `AgentSpawnParams` declares `pickable = False` explicitly, narrowing
  `SimObjectSpawnParams`' `True`, and `from_dict()` applies that default
  rather than inheriting the parent's resolved `True`. The inherited field
  order is unchanged.
- PyBulletFleet no longer configures the root logger. `logging.basicConfig()`
  on import changed the format of the host application's own output, and
  constructing a simulation called `logging.getLogger().setLevel(...)` from
  `log_level` -- which defaults to `warn`, so merely building a simulation
  turned off every INFO line in the process. Both now apply to the
  `pybullet_fleet` logger, which carries its own handler.

- A headless simulation no longer opens a monitor window. `enable_monitor_gui`
  now defaults to `None`, meaning "follow `gui`"; an explicit `True` or
  `False` is still honoured, so a monitor window without the PyBullet viewer
  remains available. Building several simulations in one process -- a test
  suite, a parameter sweep -- used to put a Tk window on screen per
  simulation.

- Include positive-gap pairs within `collision_margin` in closest-point
  collision checks, including pairs whose AABBs do not overlap.
- Isolate the macOS Tkinter monitor in its own process to avoid native GUI
  conflicts with PyBullet, while preserving monitor controls while paused.
  Keep the existing threaded startup and shutdown behavior on Windows and Linux.

## v0.8.0 (2026-09-01)

### Added

- Add OpenUSD static-world import, including PointInstancer expansion,
  PreviewSurface/Isaac material support, collision controls, and a warehouse
  example.
- Add portable BehaviorTree.CPP XML runners for generic, Agent, and Worker
  trees, with typed action/navigation contracts and a worker demo.
- Add backend-neutral elevator state-machine and motion-adapter contracts,
  including reject, queue, and replace-next request policies.
- Add configurable GUI lighting and native runtime lighting controls.
- Add interactive DataMonitor controls for simulation execution, selection,
  camera following, live timing, and paused pose editing.
- Add manager-scoped Fleet ROS interfaces, transport probes, and scale checks.

### Changed

- Reduce FleetState conversion overhead by populating generated ROS messages
  in place, and add profiler fields for collection, conversion, and publish.

### Fixed

- Serialize batch-controller path updates with simulation advancement to avoid
  concurrent ROS command dispatch corrupting vectorized trajectory state.

### Documentation

- Document the USD/USO portability roadmap, supported behavior-tree profile,
  planned device coordination, and refreshed core and ROS scale results.

## v0.7.4 (2026-08-03)

### Added

- Add `pybullet-fleet config --list`, `--path`, and `--copy` for managing
  bundled YAML configuration templates after a pip installation.
- Add model overrides to the grid demos: `--robot` for the mobile-only grid
  and `--mobile-robot` / `--arm-robot` for the mixed fleet.
- Add recorded fleet-interface and RMF office-demo videos to the ROS 2
  quickstarts.

## v0.7.3 (2026-08-02)

### Documentation

- Document the optional `python3-tk` dependency for the PyBulletFleet
  DataMonitor GUI in the ROS 2 and APT installation paths, and link the RMF
  Docker steps to the official Ubuntu Docker Engine installation guide.

### Fixed

- Avoid repeated `InvalidHandle` and shutdown errors during ROS 2 bridge Ctrl-C
  handling by stopping simulation publish callbacks before rclpy destroys
  publishers and making context shutdown idempotent.

### Performance

- Refresh core and ROS bridge benchmark references for this release; no
  release-blocking regression was observed.

## v0.7.2 (2026-08-02)

### Features

- Add an installed ROS 2 fleet demo launch for 100-robot, batched Fleet API
  navigation, shared by native Jazzy and Docker environments, with an optional
  lightweight RViz view and non-overlapping multi-robot navigation client.
- Use a Franka Panda in the ROS 2 arm trajectory demo without requiring an
  additional model package.

### Fixed

- Default the Open-RMF Office demo to real-time pacing so dispatched tasks
  progress with the simulated clock.
- Resolve RMF map `model://` furniture includes from the Gazebo Fuel cache,
  so prefetched Office and other RMF demo assets are rendered in PyBullet.

### Documentation

- Add native Jazzy bridge, Fleet API, and RMF quickstarts, with Docker moved to
  the alternative environment path, add an RMF scenario catalog and full RMF
  Web Docker workflow including a no-build RMF Web companion stack for native
  demos, and document prefetching Gazebo Fuel assets for the supported RMF demos.

## v0.7.1 (2026-08-01)

### Fixed

- Constrain NumPy and SciPy to compatible releases so a fresh installation
  continues to work with the PyBullet binary extension.

## v0.7.0 (2026-08-01)

### Features

- Add a transport-neutral fleet API with state snapshots, fleet navigation and
  joint, stop, attach, and generic action commands, `FleetStateProvider`, and
  `FleetCommandDispatcher`.
- Add stable generated names for grid-spawned robots and objects, allowing
  fleet commands and integrations to address them deterministically.
- Add `MultiRobotSimulationCore.last_profiling`, a read-only snapshot of the
  most recently measured simulation step for plugins and callbacks.
- Add fleet-level ROS 2 state and command interfaces, including 2D/3D
  navigation, joint control, stop, attach, and generic action requests.
- Add RMF fleet client modes for per-robot ROS endpoints, fleet-level ROS
  endpoints, and direct in-process Python dispatch. The direct mode dispatches
  simulator changes on the simulation step thread.
- Add configurable, Gazebo-faithful RMF workcell results and expanded support
  for RMF doors and lifts.

### Changed

- Make per-robot bridge interface groups independently configurable. Disabling
  all groups avoids creating per-robot handlers; disabling one group suppresses
  only its associated publishers, subscribers, services, or actions.
- Configure vectorized batch robot controllers through a named manager's
  `fleet_controller` mapping; entity-level `batch_controller` and
  `fleet_controller` settings are no longer accepted.
- Keep objects attached to a robot link synchronized with the current pose in
  the same simulation step.

### Breaking Changes

- ROS 2 bridge internals: `RobotHandler` is now a facade over dedicated
  interface groups. Private callback overrides such as `_cmd_vel_cb`,
  `_navigate_execute`, `_execute_action_execute`, and service callbacks are not
  supported extension points. Custom integrations should use the public ROS
  topics/actions/services or compose/replace the relevant interface group.

### Documentation

- Document the ROS 2 Jazzy APT release workflow, including a reproducible
  GitHub-hosted APT supplement repository and the required RMF demo overlay.
- Add native ROS 2, fleet API, bridge scale, and RMF dispatch guides and
  runnable Docker validation commands.

### Testing

- Add headless RMF integration coverage and end-to-end patrol and delivery
  dispatch checks, including door, lift, and workcell flows.

## v0.6.0 (2026-06-26)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed intermittent multi-second freezes during `run_simulation()`.** The
  real-time loop paced off the wall clock, so a wall-clock jump (NTP correction,
  host suspend/resume, WSL2 drift) could desync it into a long `time.sleep()` —
  the sim "froze" then "suddenly resumed". It now paces on the monotonic clock,
  converts the catch-up sleep correctly for `target_rtf != 1` (it previously
  over-slept ~`rtf`×), and clamps any residual sleep so it can never freeze.

### Features

- Added `SimulationParams.max_sleep_frames` (default 4.0) to bound the real-time
  sleep, mirroring the existing `max_steps_per_frame` catch-up cap.

## v0.5.0 (2026-06-25)

Try the examples straight from a `pip install` — no repo clone needed.

### Features

- **Examples ship in the wheel + a `pybullet-fleet` CLI.** After
  `pip install pybullet-fleet`, list / locate / copy / run the bundled demos:
  ```
  pybullet-fleet examples --list
  pybullet-fleet examples --path
  pybullet-fleet examples --run path_following_demo.py [--robot racecar]
  pybullet-fleet examples --copy ./my-examples
  ```
  `--run` forwards extra flags to the demo; `--copy` extracts them for editing.
- Expose `pybullet_fleet.__version__`.

### Internal

- Bridge: fixed the previously-failing `pybullet_fleet_ros` tests and now run
  `colcon test` in CI (the bridge unit tests were never gated before).
- Added a clean-install CI check that the published wheel actually ships the
  bundled examples, and per-demo compile tests so a broken example is caught.

## v0.4.1 (2026-06-24)

Packaging patch: the v0.4.0 wheel shipped **without** its bundled data, so
pip-installed users could not load the built-in robots, configs, or meshes.
This release makes that data ship in the wheel and resolve correctly.

### Bug Fixes

- Bundle the built-in `robots/`, `config/`, and `mesh/` data in the wheel —
  pip-installed users can now load the bundled URDFs, configs, and meshes that
  were missing from the v0.4.0 wheel.
- Resolve bundled assets from a relative path (e.g. `"config/config.yaml"`,
  `"robots/arm_robot.urdf"`) whether you run from the repo or a pip install.

### Internal

- Add a clean-install packaging smoke test (`make test-clean-install`, a
  standalone script, and a Docker image) plus a release-time wheel-verify gate,
  so missing bundled data is caught before publishing.
- Add CI coverage: path-filtered packaging (clean-venv install) and ROS 2
  bridge (Docker integration) workflows.
- Pin `numpy<2` in the bridge image to match the ROS 2 Jazzy runtime.

## v0.4.0 (2026-06-22)

First release with the **ROS 2 bridge and Open-RMF integration**, an event
system, SDF world loading, vectorized batch controllers, and a plugin/device
architecture.

### Highlights

- **ROS 2 bridge** (`ros2_bridge/`, ROS 2 Jazzy) — drive PyBulletFleet from ROS 2:
  per-robot odom / TF / cmd_vel / goal_pose / joint topics; NavigateToPose,
  FollowPath and FollowJointTrajectory actions; and `simulation_interfaces`
  services (spawn / delete / get entities, step simulation, simulator features).
  Dockerized with an integration smoke test.
- **Open-RMF integration** — fleet adapter plus handlers for doors, lifts,
  delivery, cleaning, and battery, with runnable demos: office, hotel, clinic,
  airport_terminal, battle_royale, and campus.
- **EventBus** — global and per-entity lifecycle events (object/agent spawn &
  remove, pre/post step & update, action start/complete, collision enter/exit)
  for plugins and external integrations.
- **SDF loader** — load multi-model SDF worlds, with `<submesh>` extraction from
  multi-part meshes, `model_yaw_offset`, and `force_color` flat-shading for
  meshes PyBullet cannot texture.
- **Batch controllers** — vectorized omnidirectional and differential controllers
  (two-phase step) for efficiently simulating large fleets.
- **Plugin & device architecture** — per-agent plugins (e.g. battery) and
  simulation plugins (e.g. workcell delivery); `Door` and `Elevator` agent
  subclasses with joint control and automatic passenger attachment.

### Features

- Unified `controller=` API: registry name, dict, list, `ControllerParams`, or a
  prebuilt controller; `type:` (registry) / `class:` (dotted import path)
  selection; patrol and random-walk high-level controllers; per-axis kinematic
  limits and `navigation_2d`.
- `resolve_model()` resolves Tier 1/2/3 model names (bundled, ROS description
  packages, `robot_descriptions`) to URDF paths.
- `CameraController` — interactive right-drag pan, zoom, and top-down view.
- `pybullet_fleet_msgs` package (ExecuteAction action).

### Bug Fixes

_(Fixes to behaviour from v0.3.0; issues introduced and resolved within this
release's new features are omitted.)_

- Collision detection was silently disabled when the simulation was loaded from
  YAML — the `collision_detection_method` string is now coerced to its enum.
- Per-axis velocity/acceleration limits with a zero-capped axis (e.g.
  `max_linear_vel: [0.3, 3.0, 0.0]`) no longer produce a NaN limit.

### Documentation

- ROS 2 bridge / Docker guide; corrected headless, env-var, and config-file docs;
  2026-06-20 implementation audit; a single shared agent-instructions source for
  GitHub Copilot and Claude Code.

### Performance

- Kinematics mode (headless, AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350): ~64× real-time at 100
  agents, ~10× at 500, ~4.4× at 1000. See `docs/benchmarking/results.md`.

## v0.3.0 (2026-04-08)

### Breaking Changes

- `DifferentialPhase` removed — motion phase logic is now owned by `DifferentialController` / `OmnidirectionalController` in `controller.py`

### Highlights

- **SimulationRecorder** — Headless and GUI video capture (GIF/MP4) via `start_recording()` API or `RECORD` environment variable
- **Centralized defaults** — All parameter defaults in `_defaults.py` with `PBF_*` env-var overrides and `.env` file support
- **Visual documentation** — Embedded demo videos across all doc pages, YAML-driven batch capture scripts
- **Robot model resolution** — `resolve_model("panda")` finds URDFs/SDFs by name across local, pybullet_data, and robot_descriptions sources (`resolve_urdf` kept as deprecated alias)
- **Controller refactor** — `Controller` extracted from `Agent` into `controller.py`, reducing `agent.py` by ~500 lines
- **Entity registry** — `register_entity_class()` for custom spawn types via YAML config

### Features

- `SimulationRecorder` — camera modes (auto, gui, orbit, manual), time bases (sim, real), GIF/MP4 output
- `start_recording()` / `stop_recording()` on `MultiRobotSimulationCore`; `RECORD` env-var enables auto-recording in `run_simulation()`
- `_defaults.py` — single source of truth for all defaults; `PBF_{SECTION}_{KEY}` env-var overrides; `.env` auto-loading via python-dotenv
- `robot_models.py` — `resolve_model()`, `auto_detect_profile()`, `register_model()`, `discover_models()`, `add_search_path()` (`resolve_urdf()` kept as deprecated alias)
- `controller.py` — `OmnidirectionalController`, `DifferentialController` extracted from Agent
- `entity_registry.py` — `register_entity_class()` for extensible YAML-driven spawning

- `[models]` extra in `pyproject.toml` — `pip install pybullet-fleet[models]` pulls `robot_descriptions`
- New demo scripts: `capture_demo.py` (headless), `capture_screen_demo.py` (GUI), `capture_model_catalog.py`
- Examples reorganized into `arm/`, `basics/`, `mobile/`, `scale/`, `models/` subdirectories
