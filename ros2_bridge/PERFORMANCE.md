# ROS 2 Bridge Performance Notes

This file captures current ROS 2 bridge scale observations before the content is
promoted into the ReadTheDocs ROS 2 Bridge section.

## Interface Modes

- `fleet`: exposes fleet-level ROS endpoints such as `/fleet/states`,
  `/fleet/navigate`, and `/fleet/joint_command`. This is the scalable default
  for large fleets and RMF integration.
- `per_robot`: exposes per-robot ROS interfaces such as `/{robot}/odom`,
  `/{robot}/goal_pose`, services, and action servers. This is useful for
  compatibility and debugging, but endpoint count grows with robot count.
- `hybrid`: enables the fleet API and selected per-robot interfaces at the same
  time. Hybrid should not imply exposing every per-robot interface for every
  robot at large scale; use it selectively.

## Scope

The numbers below were collected with the Docker fleet scale checker. Unless
otherwise stated, scale checks use lightweight `simple_cube` robots as the
large-fleet baseline; detailed mobile or manipulator models should be measured
separately.

```bash
cd docker
docker compose run --rm --no-deps \
  -v "$(pwd):/docker:ro" \
  bridge bash /docker/test_fleet_scale.sh --robots 1000 \
    --interface-mode fleet --command-interface fleet \
    --publish-rate 5 --target-rtf 1.0
```

The checker sends commands and verifies that commanded robots start moving. For
per-robot topic commands this is important: publish-loop time alone is not an
end-to-end performance metric.

Add `--measure-transport` to enable the separate `TransportTiming` probe and
report message timing for the `/fleet/states` and `/fleet/navigate` service
paths. The checker runs in a separate process from the bridge. For
`/fleet/states`, the bridge publishes a timing record immediately alongside
the real FleetState; the checker matches the record to the FleetState header
stamp and measures callback receive time. For `/fleet/navigate`, the probe
reports request receive and response-ready times while the checker records
request send and response receive. Existing public FleetState, FleetNavigate,
and CommandAck definitions are unchanged. Wall-clock values are valid for
same-host/container measurements; cross-host measurements require synchronized
clocks.

For the `/fleet/navigate` topic, the probe reports client publish to bridge
callback start and callback dispatch completion. It has no response leg and
does not claim that the robots have begun moving; use the existing motion check
when that boundary matters.

For repeatable service distributions, use `--fleet-service-repeats N`. Each
request carries one `goals_2d` entry per robot and receives a unique
`command_id`; it therefore measures repeated full-fleet commands rather than
single-robot requests.

Example:

```bash
docker compose run --rm --no-deps \
  -v "$(pwd):/docker:ro" \
  bridge bash /docker/test_fleet_scale.sh --robots 1000 \
    --interface-mode fleet --command-interface fleet \
    --publish-rate 5 --measure-transport --measure-rtf \
    --fleet-service-repeats 10
```

To measure repeated full-fleet topic commands without deliberately filling the
topic queue, use `--command-interface fleet_topic --fleet-topic-repeats 10`.
The checker waits for each callback-completion probe before publishing the next
topic command when transport measurement is enabled.

`--interface-mode` configures which ROS interfaces the bridge exposes.
`--command-interface` is an advanced checker option that selects which command
path is exercised during the measurement. In normal runs they should match
(`fleet/fleet` or `per_robot/per_robot`). Mismatched combinations are mainly for
hybrid overhead and compatibility debugging.

Use `--target-rtf 0 --measure-rtf` when measuring the maximum observed RTF. The
RTF value is computed from `/clock` simulation time over wall time after the
command check has completed.

`timestep` is a core part of any RTF comparison. The current scale-check
template does not override `simulation.timestep`, so it uses the PyBulletFleet
default `0.1s` timestep. The bridge logs this as `dt=0.1000s`. `publish_rate`
is independent from timestep: it throttles ROS publication (`/clock`,
`/fleet/states`, per-robot state, TF) but does not change how often the
simulation advances. For example, with `timestep=0.1s`, `target_rtf=0`, and
`publish_rate=5Hz`, the simulation advances by 0.1 simulated seconds per step
as fast as possible, while ROS output is published every 0.2 simulated seconds.

## Current Findings

Fleet-only is the scalable baseline. In the current Docker environment, a
1000-robot fleet-only run with `target_rtf=1.0` returned `/fleet/navigate` in
tens of milliseconds and verified motion shortly after.

The fleet-only maximum-RTF result should be compared against PyBulletFleet-only
benchmarks with the same robot count, timestep, controller, physics mode, GUI
setting, and motion workload. If the PyBulletFleet-only baseline is
substantially faster under those same conditions, the difference is attributable
to ROS bridge overhead: ROS node spinning, message construction, serialization,
DDS publication, service handling, and fleet-state snapshot conversion.

Hybrid mode is sensitive to per-robot endpoint count. Exposing per-robot state
publishers, TF, command topics, services, or actions can add seconds of
`/fleet/navigate` service latency at 1000 robots. Lowering `publish_rate` helps
when state publishers and TF are enabled, but it does not remove the endpoint
count cost.

The slowdown is primarily visible before command ack, not after ack. In hybrid
mode the bridge still accepts one fleet-level command, but the same ROS node also
owns many per-robot publishers/subscriptions/timers and may be constructing and
publishing per-robot state and TF messages while servicing `/fleet/navigate`.
Those per-robot ROS entities increase executor and DDS graph overhead, and the
extra publish work competes with service handling. Once the fleet command is
accepted, all robots still start moving quickly in the measured cases.

Per-robot topic commands are not equivalent to fleet service commands. They are
fire-and-forget and can look fast if only publish time is measured. With motion
verification enabled, hundreds of per-robot topic commands did not reliably
apply to every robot in the current bridge setup.

Per-robot action servers are not viable at 1000 robots in the current Docker
environment. Creating the action-server-heavy configuration can abort in the
DDS/RCL layer.

## Representative Results

These are single-run diagnostic numbers, not stable CI thresholds.

Unless a label explicitly says otherwise, every duration and latency below is
wall-clock time. This includes publish-loop time, command acknowledgement,
motion verification, and all transport p50/p99 values. `target_rtf` is a
configured simulation pacing target, while `Observed RTF` and `max RTF` are the
ratio of `/clock` simulation time to wall-clock time. Message sizes, robot
counts, and probe-match counts are not timings.

| Mode | Robots | Groups | publish_rate | target_rtf | Command ack (wall) | All moved after ack (wall) | Result |
|------|--------|--------|--------------|------------|--------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| `fleet` | 100 | none | 5 Hz | 0 | 0.089 s | 0.007 s | max RTF 111.41x |
| `fleet` | 500 | none | 5 Hz | 0 | 0.264 s | 0.035 s | max RTF 22.32x |
| `fleet` | 1000 | none | 5 Hz | 1.0 | 0.027 s | 0.173 s | target-rate command check |
| `fleet` | 1000 | none | 5 Hz | 0 | 0.550 s | 0.083 s | max RTF 10.98x (2026-09-01) |
| `per_robot` | 1000 | `state_publishers,tf,command_topics` | 5 Hz | 0 | publish 0.217 s | 0/1000 in 60 s | max RTF 0.64x |
| `per_robot` | 100 | `state_publishers,tf,command_topics` | 5 Hz | 0 | publish 0.056 s | 15.033 s | 100/100 moved |
| `hybrid` | 1000 | `state_publishers,tf,command_topics` | 5 Hz | 0 | fleet ack 7.998 s; per-robot publish 0.220 s | not verified | max RTF 0.30x |
| `hybrid` | 1000 | `command_topics` | 5 Hz | 1.0 | 0.527 s | 0.112 s | target-rate command check |
| `hybrid` | 1000 | `state_publishers,tf,command_topics` | 1 Hz | 1.0 | 1.862 s | 0.412 s | target-rate command check (2026-09-01) |
| `hybrid` | 1000 | `state_publishers,tf,command_topics` | 5 Hz | 1.0 | 8.657 s | 0.323 s | target-rate command check |
| `hybrid` | 1000 | `actions` | 5 Hz | 1.0 | not available | not measured | DDS/RCL abort observed |

### Transport Probe Results

The following same-host Docker measurements used `--measure-transport`,
`publish_rate=5`, `simple_cube`, and `target_rtf=1.0`. The probe is enabled only
for measurement and adds one small timing topic plus a serialization-size
measurement, so these values are diagnostic rather than CI thresholds.

| Robots | FleetState bytes | State p50 / p99 (wall) | Navigate request-to-bridge (wall) | Navigate round-trip (wall) |
|--------|------------------:|-----------------------:|----------------------------------:|---------------------------:|
| 100 | 14,422 | 2.67 / 15.88 ms | 3.60 ms | 8.43 ms |
| 500 | 72,022 | 10.81 / 25.23 ms | 3.56 ms | 19.55 ms |
| 1000 | 144,022 | 19.72 / 33.49 ms | 5.03 ms | 29.05 ms |

The target-RTF comparison uses the controlled, repeated measurements below.
Do not compare unpaired single command samples across pacing modes.

At the paced 1x baseline, FleetState wire size and publish-to-callback latency
grow approximately with robot count: 14,422/72,022/144,022 bytes and
2.67/10.81/19.72 ms p50 at 100/500/1000 robots. The navigate request's
arrival at the bridge stays small (3.60/3.56/5.03 ms), while acknowledged
round-trip grows from 8.43 to 29.05 ms because the bridge must validate and
apply more robot goals. This separates transport delivery from full-fleet
command processing for capacity planning.

### Simulation Pacing Impact

The following 2026-08-08 diagnostic run used 1000 robots, 1000 `goals_2d`
entries per `/fleet/navigate` request, and ten repeated requests. All values
are wall-clock milliseconds except observed RTF.

| Target RTF | Observed RTF | State p50 / p99 | Request-to-bridge p50 / p99 | Bridge processing p50 / p99 | Navigate round-trip p50 / p99 |
|-----------:|-------------:|----------------:|-----------------------------:|-----------------------------:|-------------------------------:|
| 0 (unpaced) | 7.68x | 19.56 / 36.49 | 76.00 / 99.00 | 326.49 / 395.63 | 413.47 / 466.17 |
| 1 | 0.96x | 20.90 / 36.36 | 4.25 / 5.51 | 22.80 / 302.14 | 29.68 / 308.13 |
| 4 | 3.96x | 19.89 / 35.61 | 59.81 / 135.76 | 264.06 / 393.16 | 335.38 / 494.23 |
| 8 | 7.80x | 19.51 / 38.43 | 64.43 / 126.96 | 293.81 / 382.37 | 378.84 / 511.98 |

FleetState delivery remains about 20 ms p50 across this range. In contrast,
the 1000-goal command uses about 30 ms p50 at paced 1x and 335--413 ms p50 at
the simulator's upper-throughput range. This is the practical timing budget
for an external controller, not a simulation-correctness limit.

The scale checker verifies that accepted commands cause robots to start moving;
it does not evaluate path quality, collision behaviour, or physics accuracy.
At 8x, 100 ms of wall-clock delay spans roughly 0.8 s of simulation-clock
progress. Choose a target RTF with command-latency headroom, and repeat this
measurement for a product timing requirement before treating these diagnostic
values as a limit.

### FleetState QoS Sweep

The following 2026-08-08 native same-host run used 1000 robots,
`target_rtf=8`, `publish_rate=5`, one state subscriber, and ten full-fleet
topic commands. The timing probe remained reliable so probe matches report
FleetState deliveries. This is not a network or slow-subscriber test and does
not establish a broadly recommended default.

The scale checker uses named QoS profiles in its generated temporary bridge
configuration; they are not yet a general bridge configuration API. For
example, select the same-host best-effort profile with
`--state-qos-preset fleet_state_best_effort`; use
`--state-qos-reliability`, `--state-qos-history`, `--state-qos-depth`, or
`--state-qos-durability` only when measuring an explicit override.

| State QoS | Observed RTF | State p50 / p99 (wall) | Probe matches |
|-----------|-------------:|-----------------------:|--------------:|
| `RELIABLE/KEEP_LAST(10)` | 8.39x | 18.07 / 46.08 ms | 335 / 335 (100%) |
| `RELIABLE/KEEP_LAST(1)` | 8.53x | 18.03 / 43.27 ms | 341 / 341 (100%) |
| `BEST_EFFORT/KEEP_LAST(1)` | 8.38x | 18.10 / 44.64 ms | 340 / 340 (100%) |

No material difference appeared in this uncongested, local setup. Repeat with
slow subscribers, multiple subscribers, and a network transport before making
a reliability or depth recommendation.

### Manager-Scoped State Matrix

The following 2026-08-13 same-host Docker measurements use ten equally sized
manager scopes, `publish_rate=5`, `target_rtf=0`, `simple_cube`, and the
transport probe. They are single-run diagnostics. `Selective` subscribes only
to `manager_00`; `Complete` has one checker subscribe to all ten manager
streams; `Distributed` has one checker process per manager stream. The global
case has one `/fleet/states` subscriber.

| Robots | Case | Subscribed robots / stream | State bytes / stream | Observed RTF | State p50 / p99 (wall) |
|-------:|------|---------------------------:|---------------------:|-------------:|-----------------------:|
| 100 | Global | 100 | 14,422 | 83.24x | 1.90 / 23.60 ms |
| 100 | Manager selective | 10 | 1,550 | 305.76x | 0.37 / 1.25 ms |
| 100 | Manager complete | 10 x 10 | 1,550 | 47.78x | 0.45--0.49 / 1.82--2.37 ms |
| 500 | Global | 500 | 72,022 | 18.21x | 9.57 / 33.23 ms |
| 500 | Manager selective | 50 | 7,630 | 114.83x | 1.02 / 2.65 ms |
| 500 | Manager complete | 50 x 10 | 7,630 | 16.22x | 1.07--1.15 / 2.56--3.17 ms |
| 1000 | Global | 1000 | 144,022 | 10.60x | 19.11 / 45.75 ms |
| 1000 | Manager selective | 100 | 15,230 | 70.58x | 1.91 / 20.68 ms |
| 1000 | Manager complete | 100 x 10 | 15,230 | 10.17x | 1.89--2.04 / 17.18--32.96 ms |
| 1000 | Manager distributed | 100 x 10 | 15,230 | 7.64x | 2.27--2.43 / 4.16--5.21 ms |

Probe matches were 99.5--100%. Per-stream p99 is not full-snapshot completion
latency: manager streams are published sequentially by one bridge process, so a
client that needs every manager must also wait for the final stream.

The 1000-robot global, selective, and complete rows were refreshed on
2026-08-16 after the FleetState message-conversion optimization. Payload sizes
and same-host delivery medians remain nearly unchanged because the optimization
removes bridge-side Python allocations, not DDS wire work.

Manager interfaces are useful for ownership boundaries and selective
observation. One active manager subscriber lets the bridge skip the other nine
state conversions. Subscribing every manager stream creates ten messages but
does not parallelize the bridge, so total state work is higher than one global
snapshot. Separate subscriber processes reduce client-side fan-out contention,
not bridge serialization work.

### FleetState Publication Profile

The following representative same-host Docker diagnostic uses 1,000
`simple_cube` robots, one global `/fleet/states` subscriber, `publish_rate=5`,
and `target_rtf=0`. Values are averaged per simulation step; state publication
occurs every second step at the configured 0.1 s timestep.

| Profile field | Average per step | Meaning |
|---------------|-----------------:|---------|
| `total` | 8.38 ms | Complete simulation step |
| `events_post_step` | 7.55 ms | Complete bridge callback work |
| `fleet_state_collect` | 3.08 ms | Build transport-neutral state snapshots |
| `fleet_state_message` | 2.77 ms | Construct the ROS `FleetState` message |
| `fleet_state_publish` | 1.48 ms | Local `rclpy.publish()` call, including hand-off toward serialization |

The three FleetState fields total 7.33 ms per step, about 87% of the measured
step time. Same-host DDS delivery is measured separately with the transport
probe; it is not included in `fleet_state_publish`.

The generated-message allocation reduction changed the representative
1,000-robot message-conversion measurement from 4.34 to 2.59 ms per step and
observed RTF from 10.38x to 12.08x in matched diagnostic runs. Collection
remains the largest FleetState subphase; it is an O(N) immutable state capture
shared conceptually with the planned snapshot/replay and co-simulation work.
Use `docker/fleet_state_message_profile.py` and
`benchmark/profiling/fleet_state_collection.py` to refresh these measurements
when changing either path.

### Matched Core and Bridge Comparison

The following 2026-08-16 comparison uses the same generated 1,000
`simple_cube` YAML, `physics=false`, `timestep=0.1`, `target_rtf=0`, and a
static workload. Each case warms up for one wall-clock second and measures for
six seconds. The bridge cases have a `/clock` subscriber so observed RTF uses
the same boundary as the scale checker; no command is sent.

| Case | Observed RTF | Approx. step time | Increment over core-only |
|------|-------------:|------------------:|-------------------------:|
| Core only | 274.14x | 0.365 ms | baseline |
| Fleet bridge, no FleetState subscriber | 239.08x | 0.418 ms | 0.053 ms |
| Fleet bridge, one `/fleet/states` subscriber | 10.94x | 9.141 ms | 8.776 ms |

Creating the ROS node, Fleet endpoints, executor, and `/clock` path costs
about 0.053 ms per step in this scenario. The dominant cost is therefore not
ROS bridge residency but the requested FleetState snapshot conversion and
publication. The subscribed case includes bridge-side state collection,
message construction, and `rclpy.publish()` work; same-host DDS callback
delivery remains a separate transport-probe measurement.

Reproduce the core-only row with `docker/core_scale_rtf.py` and the generated
scale YAML. For the bridge-only row, run `test_fleet_scale.sh` with
`--command-interface none --no-state-subscription --measure-rtf`; omit
`--no-state-subscription` for the subscribed row.

### Same-Host Conclusion

For the current deployment target, keep the default FleetState QoS as
`RELIABLE/KEEP_LAST(10)`. The native same-host sweep did not show a material
RTF or delivery-latency benefit from changing either reliability or depth, and
the reliable default preserves complete delivery semantics for ordinary local
clients. This is a deployment decision, not a claim that the same profile is
best across a network or with a slow subscriber.

`Command ack` is the `/fleet/navigate` service response time. `All moved after
ack` or `All moved after command publication` is a separate checker result based
on observed robot state after the command is accepted or published. Ack and
motion-verification latency values are wall time, while max RTF is derived from
`/clock` simulation time over wall time. Use `--no-verify-motion` for RTF-only
measurements, and use motion verification when debugging command delivery
semantics.
Because motion verification is based on observed state updates, this wall-time
latency is affected by `target_rtf`, timestep, and publish timing.
Current checker output reports motion latency after the relevant boundary as
first, p50, p90, p99, and all-moved timings, plus missing robot names and final
observed positions when not all robots move within the checker window.

The latest 1000-robot publish-only check took 0.217 s for per-robot topics and
0.220 s for the hybrid per-robot command phase. Those numbers only measure
topic publication from the checker and should not be compared directly with
acknowledged fleet service calls. At 100 robots, per-robot commands moved all
robots in 15.033 s; at 1000 robots, no robot was observed moving within the
60-second verification window. This is a command-delivery/scale limitation,
not evidence that publish completion implies motion completion.

## Recommendations

- Use `fleet-only` as the default bridge mode for large fleets and RMF
  integration.
- Use hybrid mode only for debug and compatibility, and enable only the
  per-robot groups that are required.
- In hybrid mode, prefer enabling per-robot interfaces for selected robots only.
  Use `per_robot_api.include_robots` for allow-list style debugging, or
  `exclude_robots` when most but not all robots need compatibility endpoints.
  Example:

  ```yaml
  fleet_api:
    enabled: true
    states: true
    navigate: true
    joint_command: true

  per_robot_api:
    enabled: true
    state_publishers: true
    tf: true
    command_topics: true
    services: false
    actions: false
    include_robots: [robot_0, robot_1]
  ```

- Avoid per-robot action servers and per-robot services at 1000 robot scale.
- Keep `publish_rate` low when per-robot state publishers or TF are enabled.
- Treat per-robot command topics as a debug interface unless an acknowledgement
  or verification layer is added.
- Use manager-scoped state endpoints for independent operating fleets or
  selective clients. Do not subscribe every manager endpoint merely to replace
  `/fleet/states`; that increases total publish work in the current single-node
  bridge.

## Follow-Up

- Add ReadTheDocs pages under a dedicated ROS 2 Bridge section.
- Convert these notes into `docs/ros2-bridge/performance.md`.
- Add startup time, memory, DDS graph size, and RMF adapter latency measurements.
- Measure full-snapshot completion, slow-subscriber behavior, and networked
  manager subscriptions before defining a per-manager partition size limit.
- Keep Docker scale checks optional; they are diagnostic benchmarks, not stable
  unit-test gates.
