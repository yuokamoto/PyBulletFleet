tracks for one joint. It used to live in five dictionaries keyed by joint
index -- position, last target, motion profile, speed and trajectory -- which
meant five lookups per joint per step, five places to keep in step whenever a
joint was reset or restored, and nowhere to read to find out what one joint
was doing.

    ``are_joints_at_targets()`` can still be asked about it.

    *Configuration*: :attr:`max_velocity`, :attr:`max_accel` and
    :attr:`max_decel`, set through :meth:`Agent.set_joint_motion_profile`.
    Each is ``None`` until given one, and :attr:`max_velocity` then falls back
    to the URDF's ``<limit velocity>``.

    *Execution*: :attr:`speed`, :attr:`trajectory`, :attr:`trajectory_target`
    and :attr:`braking` belong to the update loop. They say how the joint is
    getting to its target right now, and mean nothing to anyone outside a
    step.
